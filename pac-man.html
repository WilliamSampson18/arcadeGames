        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the world of Pac-Man, one of the most iconic and enduring video games in the history of the arcade genre. First introduced in 1980 by Namco, Pac-Man quickly became a cultural phenomenon that transcended the boundaries of gaming. 
            The concept of Pac-Man is simple yet captivating: players navigate a yellow, circular character—Pac-Man—through a maze, consuming dots while avoiding four colored ghosts that roam the maze. If Pac-Man eats one of the four power pellets located at the corners of the maze, the ghosts temporarily turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for extra points.
            This game not only pioneered the maze chase genre but also introduced the world to one of the first gaming mascots, establishing a model for character-based gaming franchises. Pac-Man’s design was inspired by a pizza with a slice missing, and it was this simple visualization that helped make the character relatable and easy to recognize. 
            The game's success led to an array of merchandise, an animated television series, and numerous sequels and spin-offs, expanding Pac-Man’s reach beyond the arcades and into popular culture.

        <p>Pac-Man's influence extends beyond gameplay and aesthetics; it played a crucial role in the commercialization of video games. It was one of the first games to attract a significant female playing audience, breaking previous gender barriers in what was then a male-dominated area. Its strategic gameplay, which requires quick reflexes and sharp thinking, set a new standard for the gaming industry, influencing countless games that followed. 
            The game's design, with its combination of a simple, approachable concept and a non-violent theme, made it a universal favorite, accessible to all ages.
            As we look back over four decades since its release, Pac-Man remains a beloved classic, continually reminding us of the simplicity and joy of early video gaming. Its enduring popularity ensures that it continues to be discovered and enjoyed by new generations of gamers, securing its place as a timeless treasure in the arcade game legacy.
